## What is Lifecards?

Lifecards is a data driven information presentation tool.

## Who is Lifecards for?

It feels like our basic needs to organize and share information are not being well met online.
By 'our' what is meant is a range of people from individuals hosting websites or sharing content to small business owners.
There are kinds of things that we want to organize and even occasionally share that seem unduly hard to achieve.

If you're like us at all then:

1) You have a lot of 'stuff', text, images, videos or even more exotic media types that you want to organize and possibly present easily, for yourself, and even for others

2) Having your data be presentable, even beautifully laid out is important to you. You may even want highly stylized layouts with fancy 3d views in some cases.

3) Maintainabity and access to your data is critical for you. You want to using your own external tools and your own file-system as opposed to making yet another shadow copy of your data for yet another content management system.

4) Many contributors or collaborators may potentially be involved in your projects. You want them to be able to help curate the data and presentation in that case.

5) You want low cognitive overhead; you don't want to have to think hard about how to use a tool.

## What are use cases for Lifecards?

There is a popular class of "list and card" style layouts for data heavy applications that Lifecards is intended for. The more general use cases include common types of websites such as:

- Personal websites
- Blog posts
- Travel photos
- Favorite hikes
- Recipes
- Favorite books or music that I've run across recently
- Mind maps

More specifically users will almost certainly have specific interests that they want to curate, organize and possibly share. There are thousands of kinds of more specific use cases - here are just a few:

- Knitting patterns organized by difficulty
- Research materials grouped into categories
- Home-repair guides attached to a 3d model of a house
- Exercise routines shown represented on a body
- Places to go dancing arranged on a map
- Interesting upcoming events arranged in a calendar
- Friends blogs arranged by topic
- Articles tagged into groups

For users beyond individuals, such as small businesses, there's also a class of live or group managed data where many people are contributing at once such as:

- How to guides
- Documentation systems (such as gitbook)
- Product cards
- Resellers
- Recent activity and news

In the latter cases it can become more and more important to have rich query capabilities, to be able to organize collections by different criteria. Effectively there are two separate cross-cutting concerns - a "data management" concern and a "presentation" concern. These are distinct, but can overlap. Often the data needs to be marked up very clearly, and often the presentation layer needs to be able to search, sort and filter to present content as desired.

## What are goals for Lifecards?

Of course content management systems are expected to support organization and presentation of basic kinds of content
such as text, images, video. And there's a reasonable expectation to have a variety of viewers
such as lists, cards, maps, globes, timelines.
We can even expect to be able to manufacture pinterest style views, or powerpoints, or hypercard style "light programming" interfaces.

Beyond the basics there is an opportunity to go further however - and this reflects better the current implementation.
A data driven view is particularily useful for viewing the same content in many different ways.
In the near future we as consumers will probably see the emergence of heads up displays and richer viewing metaphors - where it will be common to decorate the real world with virtual data, and where 3d will be common.
Over time we want to support a rich set of viewing modes where html will not exist - and where views aremuch richer:

- Showing hikes on a 3d globe and indicating suitability for current time of year
- 3d views of information such as a 3d spiral timeline on a year basis
- Mind palace view where your data is represented as a Redwood Forest
- Audio as well such as play a collection as a music stream
- Obsidian or mind map style viewers that are diagrammatic

There's also some sensitivity to a class of multiplayer concerns. The app is written to be multiplayer with every node dynamically updating and injecting changes on the fly, and a database observer pattern is carefully used everywhere. Some of the uses include:

- Aggregation of content from other sources in real time (to the database and then reflected to the view)
- Multiplayer editing in general

## What is meant by Data Driven?

A difference in our approach is that lifecards drives all the rendering from the database state.
Data is decorated with presentation hints and that is used to guide rendering.
Note that of course your 'database' can be your file-system or however you've chosen to organize your content.

This can mean that in some senses the presentation is less flexible than a full blown CMS.
But the hope is that by reducing complexity it becomes easier to manage larger amounts of data.

## Why is it called "lifecards"?

Through-out this project a card like metaphor often emerges where a data object is represented as a single card.
We think that cards represents a pattern in how people collect, organize and share information.
As a metaphor it appears is useful and will be extended upon over time:

- Live cards that reflect say the local weather in a region or a stock market price
- Animated cards such as for deepwater fish, or plants or birds
- Cards that can act like a todo list - letting you mark off each todo item you did
- Cut, paste and remix cards to create new decks; similar to slideshare
- Print decks out as MooCards and take them with you (such "Pacific Northwest Birds")

## How about CMS XYZ?

Gardening our data is of course a perennial problem. Ever since clay tablets appeared in Mesopotamia in 2400 BC people have been struggling to organize and share information. Scribes in monastaries have shuffled paperwork for eons. Tim Berners Lee wrote the web as an attempt to try tackle this. Ted Nelson wrote Project Xanadu for similar reasons. Hypercard was developed by Bill Atkinson as yet another response to this perennial challenge.

Today there are many active projects, content management systems and organizational schemes available to us. It is in fact common today for larger libraries and companies to have full time digital librarians to manage their archives and content. None of these seem to be exactly right for the needs being tackled here.

Some of the technical criteria here were:

- Data Driven. Lifecards is purely data driven with all layout based on hints from data objects from a database.
- Multiplayer. Database queries are treated as ongoing event observers. The intent is to facilitate multiplayer interaction by design.
- Crumpled data model. The schema for objects is somewhat informal and colloquial for ease of use.
- Fine grained concepts of ownership, perms, grouping and so on using ACLS.
- DOM abstraction. We wanted to avoid being tied to html to allow for later running on native platforms.
- No compilation or preprocessing. Today there is no overwhelming need to run preprocessing phases (such as react endorses).
- Client side. This engine currently can run entirely client side.
- Flat Namespace. Rather than having a /public folder I wanted to treat the entire folder space as a network visible resource.
- Submodules. The intent is to not have a npm_modules or some other crate/module scheme but to include this entire engine as a sub folder for other projects.

And some of the critiques of other systems were:

- Presentation tools are highly opinionated and frankly limited
- Systems are often highly centralized, entirely closed source and outside of our control
- Data has to be poured into their system and it can vanish at any time
- Hosting it yourself can require servers and specialized skills to run and manage
- Tools have complex layout capabilities that take real work to master
- A full time digital librarian or curatorial role is sometimes needed

# Using Lifecards
---

## Getting Started

Fetch lifecards from <a href="https://github.com/makerlab/lifecards">https://github.com/makerlab/lifecards</a>

Install <a href="https://deno.land">Deno</a>.

Using a terminal window run this script in the root of the project to start things up:

./run.sh

Open a browser on the localhost port to view the app - usually <a href="http://localhost:8080">localhost:8080</a>.

Lifecards is a demonstration of itself.
You can edit the content in the /data folder and see the results by refreshing your browser window.

## How does one use lifecards?

After you are up and running you are then going to want to actually customize your first site. The Lifecards site itself is an example of Lifecards. Modifying the files here is a good way to become familiar with the core concepts.

To start, modify the content in /data/data.js. Lifecards is data driven and all layout and data are specified in files here. You'll quickly get a feel for how the view is composed. Various kinds of components are described further on.

## Bootstrapping for more serious developers

The index.html file demonstrates how to bootstrap lifecards. You can also do this yourself and embed the project in other tools. Bootstrapping requires first making a DB() database and then making a DOM() layout manager. The DOM() layout manager is driven by telling it what to make. Many of the dom nodes are able to query the database to fetch and produce yet other nodes and to thus produce the display.

## Node structure

Lifecards consumes a directed acyclic graph of "nodes" that are specified in the database. A node is really just a json blob with some conventions about what is in it. Typically a database is actually just a file system or an unstructured datastore such as mongodb or firebase.

Nodes crumple or squish together both the concept of "being data" (holding important values) and "being presentation" (holding values related to presentation). By "crumple" or "squish" it is meant that the node namespace is "as flat as possible" (this is a design maxim) but this *also* means that there can conceivably be collisions between concepts in the data space and concepts in the presentation space.

Typical nodes look like this:

	{
		uuid:"/mydomain.com/comicbooks",
		label:"Comics!",
		art:"/assets/bird.jpg",
		query:"*",

		kind:"area",
		thumb:"/assets/.thumb.bird.jpg"
		content:"Best Comics Ever",
		children: [ { content:"Comics!"} ],
		stylize:{
			width:"320px",
			border:"3px solid blue"
		}
	}

Here we see two disjoint domains crumpled together: The first few tokens (uuid, age ...) are "data". They refer to concepts that are important to you in a durable, presentation independent sense. The latter tokens refer to presentational or layout concerns.

Because lifecards is data driven one can reasonably expect to be able to view this item by itself. Items can be viewed by themselves (often) directly, but ALSO will often show up in a parent (as a result of a parent query).

If the item is being viewed by itself then the "kind" of presentation widget that will be used in this above example is called an "area" widget. That actual layout mechanic and actual code is located in /js/area.js . Note that many widgets are more or less empty because there is a powerful base class that enhances ALL html dom elements with features here. "Kind" translates directly to a widget if any, otherwise an ordinary HTML dom type is manufactured - if kind was "div" for example a "div" is manufactured as the container.

If a leaf node is not meant to be shown by itself then it's not really important to specify the "kind" of layout style that it has because the parent scope will often coerce the rendering style (plucking out what hints it can from the child node and painting those however it wishes).

Every node in that graph that is handed to the DOM is treated as potentially renderable. Only nodes that are handed to the Dom end up being rendered.

There are some design choices that we've made in the internal structure of data:

- data objects uuids should avoid collisions world wide
- it is best for each project have its own dns domain
- database is conceptually a directed acyclic graph
- we are planning on implementing a variety of scanners and bridges from other data storage systems aside from the filesystem

## Vanilla DOM Components: div, P, h1, h2, h3 and so on

A node that is a display widget is conceptually referred to as a 'component'.

A node or component can have a "kind" field and if specified that specific item is produced. It is therefore possible to compose fairly ordinary HTML with a fairly wide range of approaches in a data driven way with Lifecards if desired:

	{
		kind:"div",
		stylize:{ border:"3px solid blue"},
		content:"<h1>Welcome to the future</h1>",
		markdown:"# The FUTURE IS NOW",
		children:[
			{content:"This is a div"},
			{kind:"p",content:"This is a p"},
			{kind:"h1",content:"This is an h1"},
		],
		query:"tag=blue"
	}

## Area Component

Area will support pagination [TBD]

## Base Component

Base is a powerful base node type that has its resolve() method injected into every other node giving those other nodes a core set of powers.  It gives nodes the ability to resolve fields including content, stylize, query and children.

## Card Component

Card is the first step towards generalized card layout capabilities. It is currently capable of presenting one card style. [TBD]

## Link Component

Link is a shim around the vanilla dom 'a href' element. The issue was that we didn't want to overload "a" and we wanted to standardize property field setting a bit. There's some argument that it could be removed but it's still present for now. [TBD]

## Logo Component

Logo is the first of a series of very rich artful effects. Lifecards as a whole is intended to be fun, light and pretty, not just a dry serious tool. Many 3d elements will be written as well [TBD].

## Footer Component

Footer wraps up footer related concerns; mostly a @media day night sensitive footer region. While this could easily be a vanilla DOM element it felt like it was worth promoting to be a full blown concept by itself.

## Nav Component

Nav provides a basic navigation bar. Semantically the design intent is that this is a palette or toolbar for applications that shows up on every page. It will highlight the current page if the current page is an URL in the navbar [TBD].

## Routable Component

Routable shows whatever the URL is set to. This is a way to have multiple pages in a SPA (single page application).

Lifecards ALWAYS intercepts ALL local URLS. This may need to be more flexible eventually [TBD].

# Theory
---

This is a very quick primer on some of the concerns that people will have around taking "data" and presenting it.

## Data Import / Organization

The current version just uses simple json files that hold all data. The intent however is to have hooks for richer import sources. There is definitely a plan to include scanners and database bindings (later) [TBD]. In general you will have to have some kind of adaptor that bridges your data to the lifecards system. Data is always going to exist in multiple places.

Your goal (in general) is to have a 'source of truth' or a canonical place for data. This includes heavy data (text, images, content) and a lighter metadata (creation date, author, tags). Often a database or a lookaside file near the content itself will store the metadata. Often vanilla filesystems are used for heavy assets - or industrial strength data stores. In most cases the storage system allows decoration of files with metadata.

For heavy assets typically I recommend trying to create some kind of directed acyclic graph on disk - basically files and folders and using that as an overarching filing system. I recommend fairly soft and loose folder names such as "text", "travel" and so on. It is tricky finding general labels, but risky to be overly specific at this level. It's also less important that these be extremely accurate, and more important that every asset has one resting place. I've personally had a tendency to categorize data into year bucket folders but mileage may vary.

You'll never have a perfect organization. It is in fact not physically possible to perfectly organize data. Data is necessarily going to be mis-categorized as a fundamental side-effect of disjoint classification. There are many papers and books on categorization theory, prototype theory, and theories of partitioning that discuss these issues.

## Presentation: Color, Style, Layout, Components

Below the components we provide are lower level concerns around layout, readibility, aesthetics, usability (especially for people who are differently abled). There are tons of sites that talk about user interface considerations, fonts, kerning, spacing, color and so on. Also most low level style and component frameworks such as tailwind, bootstrap and so on have very very good and somewhat standardized opinions on these factors. It's worth browsing if you;re not familiar with these resources.

You should be able to use the current tools as is but you can also customize if you wish. It's important to customize because reader fatigue sets in if the same patterns are visually seen over and over. Customization can be achieved by including your own css or by hand styling each of your elements, or by adding new kinds of elements even (if you're a programmer). You'll want to familiarize yourself with design theory resources if you start messing around with layout beyond what is provided. The current version DOES attempt to set a few basics:

- fonts and font kerning are set to be reasonable
- spacing
- default colors
- a night mode for color
- narrow mode for mobile support
- a general philosophy of centering content for simple quick satisfying layout wins

There is a very strong attempt in lifecards to provide only the absolute minimal design at the core. But the components can implement their own fancy styles beyond that.

Look at the tailwind docs for good examples of higher level layouts and components for the web. Also there are a number of resources for doing design usability for real world human spaces, for real world artifacts, for 3d interfaces such as for video games. These may feel esoteric but do represent valuable thinking outside of the space of the web and can inform your work.

# QUIRKS
---

Deno. This project uses Deno at the moment (see Deno server in /utils/server.js). The server role is largely to serve http files from the current folder. There's no particular reason I'm using Deno and it can be replaced with any server such as nodejs/express or firebase or whatever you wish.

SPA. This is a single page app. On the server side I *do* re-direct some path requests back to the root index.html to allow for persistent urls. My strategy is that if a path does not end in a .jpg or some other mime type then I assume it is a request for SPA route - and I serve the index.html page. Firebase does something similar fwiw.

No public folder. It's worth noting that I treat the entire current folder as a web visible space - as opposed to the way that you'd typically expose only a /public folder. This is because the database wrapper maps to the local file-system. I want to be able to stand up instances of lifecards as a data-presentation layer for arbitrary file-systems. This does introduce a quirk where the server itself could be fetched and downloaded by the client - and of course you want to avoid having any secrets in the current folder.

No precompilation (at the moment). Webpack and so on are not used. I just find the package.json and nodejs webpack philosophy and so on to be an incredible mess and unnecessary complexity. I don't like pre-compilation and it's "good enough" to just edit live files that are served directly to the client for me for now. You're welcome to build a more complex regeneration phase if you wish. Almost everything in this project uses a "keep it as simple as possible" approach.
