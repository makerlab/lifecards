# Getting Started

Fetch lifecards from <a href="https://github.com/makerlab/lifecards">https://github.com/makerlab/lifecards</a>

Install <a href="https://deno.land">Deno</a>.

Using a terminal window run this script in the root of the project to start things up:

./run.sh

Open a browser on the localhost port to view the app - usually <a href="http://localhost:8080">localhost:8080</a>.

Lifecards is a demonstration of itself.
You can edit the content in the /data folder and see the results by refreshing your browser window.
