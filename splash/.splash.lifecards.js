# Lifecards: Data-Driven Presentation Tool

## Data-Driven

Lifecards is a data-driven CMS, intended to help reduce labor for people who have a *lot* of content to manage. Users can define layout within the user database by editing simple config files.

- It is a bit like React, in that it can do layout, has widgets, a router and opinions.
- It is a bit like Wordpress, in that it also aims to manage the data it stores.
- It is a bit like Figma, or even Obsidian, in that its goal is to display information in pretty ways.
- It is a bit like Pinterest, in that card-like layouts are a core motif.

## Use Cases

You can use Lifecards for presenting almost any sort of stockpiled personal content, from websites and blogs to photo albums and audio recordings.
There will be widgets for many presentational styles from card layouts to timelines to maps and globes; stay tuned.
