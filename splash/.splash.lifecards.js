# Lifecards: Data Driven Presentation Tool

## Data driven

Lifecards is a data driven CMS where the layout is defined in the database.

It's intended to help reduce labor for people who have a lot of content to manage.

- It is a bit like React in that it can do layout, has widgets, a router and opinions.
- It is a bit like Wordpress in that it also has an idea of managing data woven into it.
- It is a bit like Figma or even Obsidian in that the goal is help show information in pretty ways.
- It is a bit like Pinterest in that card like layouts are a core motif.

## Use Cases

Lifecards can present personal content, websites, blogs, photo albums or in other kinds of data heavy use cases.
There will be widgets for many presentational styles from card layouts to timelines to maps and globes.
